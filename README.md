# "Midge", an SPCL badge

![The MINGLE MIDGE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TUDelft-SPC-Lab/spcl_midge_hardware/master/Media/v2.3.jpg)

## Environment Setup:

1. Install the `arm-none-eabi` toolchain (compiler and binutils) for your distro <https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads>
    * To avoid issues it is recommended to have matching `gcc` and `gdb` versions from the toolchain
    * The `gdb-multiarch` package in ubuntu is know to cause debug errors when used with the `arm-none-eabi`'s `gcc`.
    * Version 13.3 is known to work well
2. Install the openocd debugger 
    * For ubuntu `sudo apt install openocd`
    * For a different OS: <https://openocd.org/>
3. Install the dependencies for visualising the debug logs:
    * For ubuntu `sudo apt install socat picocom`
    * For a different OS: TODO
3. Install the nRF5 SDK
    * Download the nRF5 SDK version 15.3.0 from <https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nrf5-sdk/download>
    * Create a folder for housing the SDK in your home folder
        ```Shell
        mkdir ~/nRF5_SDK_15.3.0 -p
        ```
    * Extract the SDK zip in the folder created in the previous step
    * Modify `~/nRF5_SDK_15.3.0/components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.posix` so `GNU_INSTALL_ROOT` points to your `arm-none-eabi` toolchain.
      If the binary is already in your `PATH`, so just set `GNU_INSTALL_ROOT :=`.
      For example `GNU_INSTALL_ROOT ?= /home/user/arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi/bin/`
    * Modify `~/nRF5_SDK_15.3.0/external/fatfs/src/ffconf.h` to make the `_FS_RPATH` macro be defined as `2`.
    * For ubuntu if the sdk complains about missing `libncursesw.so.5` install it with `sudo apt install libncursesw5`.  

### Other requirements:

- You will probably have to use `conda` for setting up a python2 env. In that
  env, you will need to download the `bluepy` module

## Board options

There are several MCU boards that can be used for compiling and debuging the midge fimware.
The main requisite is that they can run CMSIS-DAP compliant firmware.
The Segger J-Link is known to provide the fastest data transfer rates, while the the Seeed XIAO SAMD21 board is more affordable and easier to acquire.

### Seeed XIAO SAMD21 board
We use the [Seeed XIAO SAMD21 board](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/) with the [Seeed DAPLink](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_DAPLink) for Cortex M0 and M4 devices.

Additionally you will need the following components:
* A pogo pin probe clip https://www.adafruit.com/product/5434
  * For a permanent solution, soldering the pins via a box header is also an option https://www.adafruit.com/product/752 
* Female to female jumper wires https://www.adafruit.com/product/1951 (this examples comes with 20, only 3 are needed)

Flash the DAPLink firmware in the SAMD21 board (only needs to be done once):
1. Connect the board to the computer via usb
2. Put the board in bootloader mode as described [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/#enter-bootloader-mode), it should show up as usb stick in the computer
3. Copy over the uf2 file from [here](http://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Seeeduino-XIAO/res/simple_daplink_xiao.uf2)
4. Disconnect and reconnect the usb cable
5. Connect the midge to the board and the board to the computer as described in [here](#Hardware-connection-to-the-board)
6. The flashing was performed successfully if the LEDs in the board turned blue and stoped flashing

### PicoProbe for RP2040 
The PicoProbe for RP2040 based MCUs like the [Pi Pico](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe/releases/tag/picoprobe-cmsis-v1.02) should also work.
   * TODO: add instructions for this board 

### Segger J-Link

1. Get a J-link debug probe from here:  https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/
The EDU version is available for educational instituions. 
2. Download and install the J Link SDK from [here](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/tools/j-link-sdk/).
3. Make sure the midge badge is powered on, and connect the J-link to the SWD programming port on the midge badge. 
4. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and enter the following command to start J-Link Commander and connect to the nRF52832 using SWD at a speed of 4 MHz:
   ```
   JLinkExe -device nRF52832_xxAA -if SWD -speed 4000
   ```
5. Flash the binary file:
   ```
   loadfile <firmware.hex>
   ```

### Hardware connection to the board

Openocd is known to crash with `Error connecting DP: cannot read IDR` when debugging the midge while plugged in to power.
To ensure a smooth debugging process follow these steps when connecting the midge to the computer.

1. Make sure the battery charged
2. Connect the board to the pogo pin and the pogo pin to the midge
   * The pin connections to the midge are described [here](https://github.com/TUDelft-SPC-Lab/spcl_midge_hardware/blob/master/PCB/Explainer.pdf)
   * The pin connections to the boards are as follows: 
      * Seeed XIAO SAMD21 board, described [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/#hardware-overview) and [here](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_DAPLink/blob/master/src/DAP_config.h#L179-L188)
      * TODO: add pin connections for the other boards
   * Note that the pogo pin switches around the A and B side of the pins
   * Do not connect the 3V pin, only the SWDIO, SWCLK and GND pins should be attached
3. Disconnect the charging cable of the midge before debugging
4. After having the connections ready, connect the debug probe to the computer 
5. Switch ON the battery

## Compile and debug

There are two options for compiling and debugging the code.
A barebones gdb server that can be executed via Makefile rules or using the VScode IDE with the Cortex-debug plugin.

### Using Makefile rules

1. Build with `make nrf52832_xxaa_debug`
2. Start the openocd server with `make openocd`
3. Start the gdb session and load the binary with `make load_gdb`
4. Start the RTT console to see log messages with `make logs`

### Using VSCode with Cortex-debug

Just download the [Cortex-Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug) and setup the `.vscode/launch.json`.
This should enable the "Run and Debug" functionality in VSCode (Left menu, green arrow to launch the application).
In the C++ extension `ms-vscode.cpptools` set the configuration to `arm-none-eabi` to get include paths for the SDK recognised by intellisense.

Example `launch.json` for using Cortex-Debug for flashing and debugging

```JSON
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Cortex Debug",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "executable": "_build/nrf52832_xxaa_debug.out",
            "request": "launch",
            "type": "cortex-debug",
            "runToEntryPoint": "main",
            "servertype": "openocd",
            "device": "nrf52",
            "configFiles": [
                "interface/cmsis-dap.cfg",
                "target/nrf52.cfg"
            ],
            "openOCDLaunchCommands": ["adapter speed 2000"],
            "interface": "swd",
            "armToolchainPath": "",
            "svdFile": "${workspaceRoot}/nrf52832.svd",
            "preLaunchCommands":["set remotetimeout 60"],
            "rttConfig": {
                "enabled": true,
                "address": "auto",
                "clearSearch": false,
                "decoders": [
                    {
                        "port": 0,
                        "type": "console"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## Flashing the final binary

1. Build with `make nrf52832_xxaa_release`
2. Start the openocd server with `make openocd`
3. Flash the binary with `make flash_with_gdb`

## Hardware

Hardware design files are in a [separate hardware repo](https://github.com/TUDelft-SPC-Lab/spcl_midge_hardware).

## Advertisment Packet structure

The advertisment packet has a field called "manufacturer specific data", with type 0xFF. It should start at the 12th byte. Its length is 11 bytes:

```C
typedef struct
{
    uint8_t battery;
    uint8_t status_flags;
    uint16_t ID;
    uint8_t group;
    uint8_t MAC[6];
} custom_advdata_t;
```

MAC is set during init, ID and group with the status command.
Battery is in percentage, and the status flags are :
bit 0: clock sync
bit 1: microphone
bit 2: scanner
bit 3: imu

0 is not active, 1 active.

## Data format

### Audio

On "high" audio is stereo, 20kHz, 16bit per channel PCM.
On "low" it is subsampled by a factor of 32, to 625Hz.

It is only timestamped when the file is created (filename is seconds).

### IMU

Filename is again timestamped, but also each sample (32 bytes):

accelerometer, gyro, magnetometer sample example:
2dd4 a69d 016d 0000 0000 3b40 0000 bc48 2000 3f83 0000 000c 0000 ffce 0000 1064

First 8 bytes are the timestamp:
2dd4 a69d 016d 0000   = 0000016da69d2dd4 = 1570458381780 milliseconds = 07/10/2019 2:26:780

4 bytes float per axis:
0000 3b40   0000 bc48   2000 3f83

padding for data alignment
0000 000c 0000 ffce 0000 1064

Rotation vector:
Timestamp is the same 8 bytes, then 4 floats per quaternion, 4 fewer bytes for padding.

### Scanner

16 byte length
Same 8 byte timestamp.
2 bytes ID
1 int8_t rssi (signed)
1 byte group
4 bytes padding


# Data recording workflow

1. Turn the midges on
2. Get their MAC address with the `scan_all.py` script
3. Start recording via `hub_V1.py` or the `badge_gui.py` scripts using the previous MAC addresses
4. Stop recording
5. Copy the data from the SDCards into a computer (for this step, take the card manually out of the midge and
   plug it in the computer) 
6. Run processing data scripts to transform the raw data into common file formats: `imu_parser_V0.py` and `audio_parser_V0.py`
